# Makuake Marketing Strategy

## 1. Target Audience (Persona)

**Primary Target**:

- **Demographics**: Men, 30s-50s.
- **Interests**: Camping, Outdoor activities, Gadgets, Crowdfunding (Makuake users).
- **Psychographics**: Values efficiency, likes new gear ("First Mover"), looks for comfort in camping (family/solo).
- **Pain Points**: "Tarp setup is difficult", "Low ceiling/cramped", "Weather worries".
- **Solution**: Double-Pole Tarp (Easy setup, Spacious, All-weather).

## 2. Creative Strategy (Ad Materials)

To be prepared by User/Designer.

- **Vertical (9:16)**: For Instagram Stories/Reels.
- **Horizontal (1.91:1)**: (Optional) for standard display.

**Content Ideas**:

- **A/B Test**: Compare "Atmosphere/Vibe" vs "Function/Utility".
- **Hook**: "Is your tarp too low?" (Problem/Solution).
- **Social Proof**: "Coming to Makuake" hype.

## 3. Numerical Goals & Budget

**Goal**: 250 - 300 LINE Friend Registrations.
**Rationale**:

- Target Supporters: ~25.
- Conversion Rate (LINE to Purchase): 5-10% (conservative estimate).
- Required Leads: 25 / 0.10 = 250.

**Budget**:

- **Total**: 250,000 - 300,000 JPY.
- **CPA Target**: 500 - 1,000 JPY per registration.
- **Allocation**: Heavily weighted towards the first 2-3 days and the final stretch, but for *Teaser*, it's a steady build-up before launch.

## 4. Teaser LP Strategy

- **Objective**: Maximize LINE adds.
- **Offer**: "Max XX% OFF" (Price hidden, discount emphasized).
- **Key Elements**:
  - First View: Impactful Image + Discount Badge + CTA.
  - Pixel: Meta Pixel / GTM installed for tracking.

## 5. Coupon Strategy

- **Action**: Consult with Makuake regarding "Coupon" issuance slots.
- **Purpose**: Boost sales if initial velocity is slow.
