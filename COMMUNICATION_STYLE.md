# Communication Guidelines

## Proactive Information Recording

- **Default Behavior**: When the user shares screenshots, contact information, or supplier details, **IMMEDIATELY** record them into a consolidated project log (e.g., `project_resources_record.md`) without waiting for specific instructions.
- **Scope**: Include names, contact details, strengths/roles, and any context provided in screenshots/chat.

# Communication Style: Shimizu Style

This document defines the preferred communication style for correspondence in this project. Use this as a reference for all drafted messages.

## General Principles

1. **Conciseness (簡潔徹底)**
    - Avoid excessive modifiers like "非常に" (very), "本当に" (truly), or "心より" (sincerely).
    - Keep sentences short and hit the point directly.
2. **Factual Tone (事実ベース)**
    - Focus on communicating facts and necessary information over emotional or social filler.
    - Remove sentences that don't add practical value (e.g., "円滑に進められると考えております").
3. **Pragmatic Politeness (実務的な丁寧さ)**
    - Use professional but flat polite Japanese (Desu/Masu).
    - Avoid overly humble (Kenjou-go) or honorific (Sonkei-go) language that feels "too much" for a standard business transaction.
4. **Copy-Paste Ready (即応性)**
    - Provide drafts in **Plain Text** without Markdown symbols (like `**` or `###`).
    - Use clean line breaks and formatting suitable for direct pasting into Gmail or other mail clients.

## Preferred Vocabulary/Phrasing

- **Instead of:** 非常に助かります (It helps very much)
- **Use:** 助かります (It helps)

- **Instead of:** お願いできますでしょうか (Would it be possible for you to...?)
- **Use:** お願いできますか (Can you please...?)
