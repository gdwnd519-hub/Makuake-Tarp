# Deployment Instructions (Main Visual Update)

I have updated the HTML code (`teaser.html`) to use your new Main Visual.
Since I cannot access your deployment folder directly, please follow these steps to update the live site:

## 1. Prepare the Image
1.  Take your final Main Visual image (from Canva).
2.  Rename the file to: `main_visual.jpg`
3.  Move this image file into your deployment folder:
    `website/double-pole-tarp/images/main_visual.jpg`

## 2. Update the HTML
1.  Open the modified `teaser.html` file in this folder.
2.  Copy **ALL** the text content.
3.  Open your deployment file:
    `website/double-pole-tarp/index.html`
4.  Paste the text (overwrite everything) into `index.html`.
5.  Save the file.

## 3. Deployment
1.  Push the changes to GitHub (or drag the folder to Vercel/Netlify as you usually do).
2.  Check the live URL to confirm the new image is visible.
